# Ethereum Transaction + Contract Demo @ W-JAX 2016

![](https://github.com/lwieske/wjax-2016-ethereum-demo/blob/master/demo800x600.gif)

The demo video (animated gif) was generated by calling

```
bash -x video-recoder.sh
```

in a iTerm2 terminal window sized 132x43 with 256 colors.

The recorder script in turn calls tmuxinator/asciinema with a session/call to
the driver script typing commands in the node/client pane (bottom/top).

Some post processing at the end of the recorder script shrinks the gif.
